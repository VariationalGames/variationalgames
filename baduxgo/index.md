Badux is the same game as Go but played on a Hex board.

Go is an ancient strategy board game originating from China over 2,500 years
ago, where players place black and white stones to surround territory and
capture opponent pieces. The game is deceptively simple in its rules yet
profound in its strategic depth, making it one of the world's oldest
continuously played board games.

The hexagonal board topology of Badux brings a fresh perspective to this ancient
game. Same elegant ruleset, but corners are different, living shapes are
different, and kos don't exist. Badux is an excellent entry point for learning
Go, as well as an interesting variation for experienced players.
